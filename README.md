# Kodi Nexus - QoL fixes

This repo includes some userdata defaults to fix some issues like HQ scaling being hard-code disabled, better episode regex, some buffer improvements, no splash screen, etc. Basically base Kodi with some common sense changes.

Also includes a "mod" of Estuary that includes year, rating and 'my rating' on the title bar on InfoWall view mode. Removes some redundant and unneded horizontal slider sections, and adds some shiny icons for the video info at the bottom (see image below).

I also uploaded a modified version of Tag Overview that works on Nexus, and revamped its GUI. I rely on this addon quite a lot to tag my movies so they go into their own Nodes (I also supplied a few default nodes that might be of your interest, aside from the bundled ones)
